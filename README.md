## Workshop Program <a name="program"></a>

The workshop aims to bring together OCR technicians and software developers in digital humanities to discuss and share their experiences, challenges, and best practices in digitization. The event will provide a forum for experts to learn from one another, and collaborate on innovative solutions to common problems.
 
In this sense, the workshop will comprise a day of meetings, presentations, and discussions, with participants encouraged to share their experiences and insights. Topics to be covered might include the latest trends and best practices in OCR technology, strategies for improving accuracy, and ways to enhance workflows and automate tasks.

### Schedule <a name="schedule"></a>
The workshop is held in two sessions during the whole day of May 4th in Groningen (NL).

The initial room is **OBS 34.002** of the Harmony Building (Harmoniegebouw) located the in the historic center of the city.
